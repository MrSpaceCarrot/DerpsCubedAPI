# DerpsCubedAPI
An API that is used by all of the services I have made for my friend group. Features include:
 - Authentication using Discord social login or an api key
 - The categorization and rating of games across various platforms
 - Starting game servers on a Pterodactyl Panel instance and getting information about them
 - An economy system

This API currently links with the following services:
- [DerpsCubed](https://github.com/MrSpaceCarrot/DerpsCubed), a website
- [MEE7](https://github.com/MrSpaceCarrot/MEE7), a discord bot
- [DerpsCubedDockerLink](https://github.com/MrSpaceCarrot/DerpsCubedDockerLink), a service to get information about game server docker containers
